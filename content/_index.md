# Hello, I'm Brad ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my digital garden!**

The main reason for creating my digital garden, is to expirement and demonstrate changes to the [Digital Garden Hugo Theme](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme) created by [apvarun](https://github.com/apvarun).

The navigation menu is generated from the config.yml file at root of the site. By using the themes config file as an example, customization of the navigation menu can be made, with some simple tweaks to the menu entries.

Along the way, I hit some roadblocks while trying to deploy the website. After abandoning the use of digitalGarden in my sites themes folder, as well as configuring the site in YAML (instead of TOML). I was able to deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

**Yay!** ðŸŽ‰

Also be sure to check out [Blog](/blog) and [Whatever](/whatever) for examples of how content structure and layouts can be created to match the menu entries in the navigation bar.

This website is a work in progress and may become a functional site at some point. For further information, check out the [Documentation](/articles) for the digital garden theme.
