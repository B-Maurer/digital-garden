# Hello, I'm Brad ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my digital garden!**

The main reason for creating my digital garden, is to expirement and demonstrate changes to the [Digital Garden Hugo Theme](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme) created by [apvarun](https://github.com/apvarun).

The navigation menu is generated from the config.toml file at root of the site. With a quick copy and paste of the themes config file, found in themes/exampleSite/config.toml, you can get the navigation up and running. With some simple tweaks the menu can be customized to fit your needs.

Make sure to check out [Blog](/blog) and [Whatever](/whatever) for examples of how content structure and layouts can be created to match the menu entries in the navigation bar.

This website is a work in progress and may become a functional site at some point. For further information, check out the [Documentation](/articles) for the digital garden theme.
